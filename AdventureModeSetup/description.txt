Welcome to Adventure Mode! This is a "metroidvania" game mode for Terraria with many new features and changes, making for a completely fresh take on the vanilla experience. Here are some of the basics:
- Building and digging disabled (some exceptions).
- Use platforms, planks, ropes, and rails (via. kits) to get around.
- House kits combine NPC housing, bedding, storage, crafting, and fast travel points.
- All crafting handled with workbenches (or occasional Demon Altars).
- Access to new areas made via special Orbs (found by discovery).
- Ammo is more expensive; use wisely.
- Talk to the Guide and NPCs for directions.

Note: This is Adventure Mode's setup mod. See the configs for options to whitelist 3rd party mods, ignore specific missing mods, etc.
